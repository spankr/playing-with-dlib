# Playing around with DLib

Yay, learning machine learning and what better than [dlib]?

## Personal Notes

- Let's start with DLib's image_ex example. Now that their examples compile, I should make sure I can bring it up in its own project.
  - (PS [OpenCV] was a bit of a pain. I had to pull v3 down via [HomeBrew].)
